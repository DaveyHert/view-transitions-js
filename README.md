# Source Code for Seamless SPA Transitions Using the New View Transitions API

The View Transitions API is designed to facilitate the creation of smooth and animated transitions between different states of the Document Object Model (DOM) in a web application. This is particularly useful in enhancing user experience by providing a visual continuity that helps users maintain their context when the content changes dynamically, such as in single-page applications.
